***** FILE ARRANGER  *****


Generally we download different type of files from the web like audio, videos, images, documents, etc. When the number of files increases, it makes the download folder messy. To solve this issue, first we need to create separate folders for different files manually. Then video files need to be placed in a folder named Video, audio files need to move to the Audio folder, photos to the Picture folder, and so on. It's a very time-consuming process if there are a huge number of files that need to be sorted. But, we don't have that much time and patience. To make this task easier, in our project we resolve this problem using GUI interface.


** Steps **

1.Select particular folder that you want to arrange

2.Then click the submit button and check the selected folder.

3.We will find that folder is neatly arranged.
